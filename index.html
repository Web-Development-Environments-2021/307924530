         <p>
             Grandpa Joe was born in New York City in November 7th, 1922, when it was still filled with sand and there were only a few houses built. <br>
             Their neighbors were mostly Native Americans, and grandpa Joe told us how his sister and him would walk afoot to their farm to get milk and eggs. <br>
             Most of his childhood he spent studying, as he was an intelectually gifted young man, and even skipped 2 grades :)<br>
             After high school he joined the US Air Force and fought in World War 2. After the war he studied in Columbia University, NYC.<br>
             Grandma Rachel was born in Bucharest, Romania in August 3rd, 1928. When she was 10 years old, her family's entire possessions were taken by the Nazis<br>
             and they all had to go underground and live in fear. <br>
             At age 15, grandma Rachel moved to Israel on her own. She lived in an agriculture boarding school and had a hard time there. <br>
             She later joined the "Lehaka Tzvai'it" (military vocal group) in the Israeli Defense Forces, and after her service moved to Tel-Aviv. <br>
             Grandma Rachel always knew she wanted to be an actress, and Tel-Aviv was her place to start. She became an actress in the Habima Theater and even changed her <br>
             last name to Timor, a name that was suggested to her by the poet Nathan Alterman fitting her "tamir" (upright, tall) looks.
             In 1956, grandma Rachel was visiting the artist village Ein Hod. <br> Grandpa Joe had arrived in Israel as a tourist and was also  <br>
             visiting the same place. The two met and only one month later they got married and moved to NYC. <br>
             There Grandpa Joe was a teacher and Grandma Rachel studied acting. My mom and her two sisters were born during the time in NYC.<br>
             Grandpa Joe was a real book worm. He would finish 400 pagers overnight. He loved art, traveling, and would spend a lot of time at the sea.
             <br>He was definitely a nonconformist at his time:<br>
             He had long hair, would go to work wearing jeans and sandals, and he never learned Hebrew even though he was a lecturer at the Hebrew University for most of his life.<br>
             Grandma Rachel was an artist in her body and soul, she had a special joie de vivre and was always creating.<br>
             Cheers guys, miss you.
